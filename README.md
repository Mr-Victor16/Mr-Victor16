### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
:information_desk_person: My name is Cezary and I'm a graduate in Computer Science with a specialization in Mobile Computer Systems.  

:computer: Currently, I'm intensively learning backend technologies and working with databases. I'm working on building my own portfolio on GitHub where I showcase projects that I'm working on as part of my learning and development.  

:date: My main professional goal is to grow as a backend developer, aiming to create applications that will have a real impact on users' lives. I'm particularly interested in projects that can solve everyday problems or make people's lives easier. I want to use my technical skills to create solutions that are both functional and useful. I'm open to new challenges and collaboration on projects that will allow me to grow as a backend developer and contribute to the creation of innovative applications.
